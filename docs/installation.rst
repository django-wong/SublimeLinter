Installation
==================

SublimeLinter and corresponding linter plugins should be installed using `PackageControl <https://packagecontrol.io/installation>`_.

First install PackageControl and then see its `usage <https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage>`_,
which explains how to install packages to SublimeText.

`Plugins <https://packagecontrol.io/search/SublimeLinter>`_ are listed on PackageControl.
Most plugins depend on command line programs to be installed on your system, be
sure to read the installation instructions for each linter plugin you install.


Notice that it may be required to restart SublimeText after package installation.

Make sure to read `SublimeLinter messages <https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/tree/master/messages>`_.
